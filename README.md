# Portfolio
Abdul Qadir is my name, and I am a software engineer in training. I am passionate about UX, UI, and Web Design. I can easily capitalize on low hanging fruit, and quickly deliver timely deliverables for real-time schemas.
I tried to apply the criteria of acceptance in order to improve my skills and build a portfolio for myself so that I will be able to share my skills with others now and in the future.

    A photo of me, links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me have been added.
    I tried and verified that the UI scrolled to the desired section, per my knowledge
    To my knowledge, I have ensured that the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.
    Attempted and ensured, to my knowledge, that the application's image gets enlarged in comparison to the others.
    According to my understanding, I have made sure that the page is viewable on various screens and devices, as well as presenting a responsive layout that adapts to the user's viewport.
    In order to make the code readable and understandable, I have tried to comment it as often as possible.
